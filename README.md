## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[HttpServer](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-threadx-wifi-http-server)" application with the desired name "HttpServer" configured for the *CYW955913EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955913EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-threadx-wifi-http-server --user-app-name HttpServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

<mark>Update the above paragraph and commands to match your CE.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable.

2. Open *web_server.h* file from the source directory and modify the `SOFTAP_SSID`, `SOFTAP_PASSWORD`, and `SOFTAP_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to the desired values that you want to allot to the SoftAP.

   All possible security types are defined in the `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in the *cy_wcm.h* file.

3. Modify the IP address assigned to the SoftAP by updating the `SOFTAP_IP_ADDRESS` macro defined in the *web_server.h* file.

    For example, if you are assigning the SoftAP with the IP address `192.168.0.2`, update the macro as follows:
    
    ```
    #define SOFTAP_IP_ADDRESS             MAKE_IPV4_ADDRESS(192, 168, 0, 2)
    ```

4. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :------- | :------------    | :------------
 UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port
 GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED         |  User LED to show the visual output


<br>

The [Wi-Fi web server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-threadx-wifi-http-server) code example configures the device in AP+STA concurrent mode and starts an HTTP web server. The HTTP web server then hosts an HTTP webpage using which the device can be connected to a Wi-Fi AP. 

The entry point of the application is `int main()`, which initializes the board support package (BSP), initializes retarget-io to use the debug UART port, and creates `server_task`. This task calls a `start_ap_mode()` function, which initializes the Wi-Fi device as a SoftAP and prints the IP address assigned to the SoftAP on the UART terminal. 

Before starting the HTTP web server, the `configure_http_server()` function registers dynamic URL handlers to handle the HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests. After this, the webpage hosted by the HTTP server can be accessed at the URL `http://<IP address>:80`, where the IP address is defined using the `SOFTAP_IP_ADDRESS` macro in the *web_server.h* file.

The data entered via the webpage undergoes URL encoding; a custom function, `url_decode()`, is used to decode the URL-encoded HTTP data.

The IP address of the STA interface is retrieved after the device gets connected to the Wi-Fi AP.

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of the standard I/O to the UART port is done using the retarget-io library.
